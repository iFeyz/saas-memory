# Technical Context

## Technology Stack
While specific technology choices aren't explicitly defined in the documentation, based on the described requirements for a modern, scalable SaaS platform, the following stack could be appropriate:

- Frontend:
  - React.js with TypeScript for building the user interface
  - Redux or Context API for state management
  - Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for UI components
  - Responsive design for multi-device support

- Backend:
  - Node.js with Express or NestJS for API development
  - Microservices architecture for modularity
  - GraphQL for efficient data querying

- Database:
  - PostgreSQL for relational data
  - MongoDB for document storage (vehicle details, etc.)
  - Redis for caching and real-time features

- Infrastructure:
  - Docker for containerization
  - Kubernetes for orchestration
  - AWS/GCP/Azure for cloud hosting
  - CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment

## Development Environment
- Local development setup with containerized dependencies
- Git workflow with feature branches and pull requests
- Testing environment separate from production
- Development, staging, and production environments
- Code quality tools (linters, formatters, etc.)
- Automated testing setup

## Build Process
- CI/CD pipeline to automate builds and deployments
- Containerized builds to ensure consistency
- Automated testing integrated into the build process
- Feature flagging for controlled rollout
- Blue/green deployment for minimal downtime
- Weekly release cycle aligning with sprint reviews

## Testing Strategy
- Unit testing for individual components
- Integration testing for module interaction
- End-to-end testing for critical user flows
- Performance testing for scalability validation
- Security testing for vulnerability detection
- Automated regression testing
- User acceptance testing with stakeholders

## Dependencies
- Authentication provider (Auth0, Firebase Auth, etc.)
- Payment processing service
- Digital signature service
- Email/SMS notification services
- Maps and location services
- Cloud storage for documents and images
- Analytics and monitoring tools

## Technical Constraints
- Must support multiple concurrent users without performance degradation
- Mobile responsiveness required for all interfaces
- Compliance with GDPR and French data protection regulations
- High availability requirement (99.9%+ uptime)
- Secure handling of customer and financial data
- Ability to customize features per client needs
- SAAS multi-tenant architecture

## API Integrations
- Payment gateways
- Digital signature providers
- Calendar/scheduling systems
- Email marketing platforms
- CRM systems
- Accounting software
- Vehicle information databases
- Maps and geolocation services

## Infrastructure
- Cloud-based hosting with autoscaling capabilities
- Database clusters with high availability
- CDN for static content delivery
- Backup and disaster recovery system
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Logging and analytics pipeline
- Security infrastructure (WAF, DDoS protection, etc.)

## Code Organization
- Module-based architecture reflecting business domains
- Separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data access)
- Shared libraries for common functionality
- Feature-based organization within modules
- API versioning strategy
- Configuration management separate from code

## Coding Standards
- Consistent code formatting and naming conventions
- Documentation requirements for all components
- Test coverage requirements
- Code review process
- Security review for sensitive components
- Performance standards for critical operations
