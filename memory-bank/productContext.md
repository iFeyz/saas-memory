# Product Context

## Problem Statement
The luxury/sports vehicle short-term rental market has experienced significant growth (8% annually from 2020-2023) with projected growth to €220-250 million by 2027. Despite this growth, there's a notable absence of modern, efficient software solutions specifically designed for short-term vehicle rental businesses, unlike the long-term rental sector where specialized solutions exist. Current rental businesses struggle with fragmented systems for managing their fleet, administration, maintenance, and client relationships, leading to inefficiencies, increased costs, and potential revenue loss.

## Target Users
- Primary: B2B luxury/sports vehicle rental companies (estimated market size €150-170 million in 2023)
- User composition: Modern, younger business owners/managers looking for efficiency
- Market segments: Luxury vehicles (45%), sports cars (35%), and supercars (20%)
- Geographic focus: Initially French market, particularly concentrated in Île-de-France and Côte d'Azur
- Secondary/future: Real estate rental businesses, maritime rental businesses, and other rental sectors
